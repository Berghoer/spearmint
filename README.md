Spearmint helps developers easily create functional React/Redux/Endpoint tests without writing any code. It dynamically converts user inputs into executable Jest test code by using DOM query selectors provided by @testing-library.

Spearmint is currently under development! We just finished our MVP and are looking for beta testers. Please open a new issue with details to report a bug.

## How to use

Download spearmint @ spearmintjs.com. Available for Mac OS and Windows.

    npm i -D jest @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/react test-data-bot

To run Redux tests generated by spearmint, install the following in your dev dependencies, in addition to your React test installations above.

    npm i -D redux-mock-store redux-thunk fetch-mock

To run Hooks / Context tests generated by spearmint, install the following in your dev dependencies, in addition to your React test installations above.

    npm i -D @testing-library/react-hooks

## How it works

1.  On the initial screen, enter the URL of your project and load your React/Redux/Node application to start creating tests.

2.  Utilize our auto-complete, drop-down options, and tooltips features to easily create arrangement, action, and assertion test statements for React; reducer, action creator, asynchronous action creator, and middleware test statements for Redux; and hooks, context,and endpoint test statements.

3.  Refer to the browser view of your app that is displayed on the right to quickly identify values for your selectors and use the file directory to open up a code editor view to easily refer to your codebase for props information.

4.  Spearmint will then convert user input to dynamically generate a test file that will be saved inside a **tests** folder, which you can use to run ‘npm test’ on.
